# naive-cnn
Convolutional Neural Network from scratch


## Requirements
Pipenv (with new Pipfile) is used. 
![Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, 
etc.) to the Python world.


#### Install Pipenv
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

#### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NISH1001/naive-cnn
```

#### Change directory
```bash
cd naive-cnn
```

#### Install dependencies from Pipfile
```bash
pipenv install
```

#### Activate the virtual environment
```bash
pipenv shell
```
